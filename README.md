## My process

- Write with semantic markup.
- Set all root figures and font.
- Plan the layout.
- Go through validators.
- Write CSS for general tags.
- Write classes' and ids' style.
- Responsive design
- Get JavaScript working
- Get all CSS done, check on both desktop and mobile.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned
The pseudo class first-letter only works for block element, the property vertical-align only works for inline element. Therefore, I turn my span into inline-block so that both first-letter and vertical-align work. For more information see (#useful-resources).
- CSS first-letter pseudo class
```css
span::first-letter {
  font-size: 2rem;
  vertical-align: 0.6rem;
  margin-right: 0.2rem;
}
```

- Foreach and arrow function

```js
array.forEach((e) => (e.style.display = "inline-block"));
```

### Continued development

Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

### Useful resources

- [CSS toggles - alvarotrigo](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/toggle-switch-css/) - This helped me style my toggle prettier.
- [CSS vertical-align](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
